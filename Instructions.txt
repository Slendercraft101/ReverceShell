HOW TO USE:

1) Open the Client file and at lines 6, 7, and 8 change the IP, Port, and USER all to 
valid info

2) If client is on same network use ipconfig in the cmd terminal and use IPv4 Address,
however if on diffrent networks open / run the Public_IP.py and copy provided IP

(You will need to place the client file in the startup menu if you want a steady
continues connection. I will add a file later to automaticly copy and run client.)
